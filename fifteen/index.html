what you're going to be seeing is an overview of my eighteen year life.

for as long as i can remember, i've been transformed and molded by the internet. this is something that feels especially scary to many people, and to others--feel silly or even sad. but the internet is something that is completely essential to my identity. when i was young, i was writing, creating, sharing, and speaking through the internet. i have lived a life here that i could never live as a girl in the philippines. it is what brings me to where i am today.

and some of these parts are lost, extinguished, archived, or just gone. but these are the parts i have salvaged, and this is a story of all those pieces.

i hope you enjoy.
